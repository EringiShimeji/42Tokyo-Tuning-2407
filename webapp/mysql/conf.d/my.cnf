# * Security Features

# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!

# Accept only connections using the latest and most secure TLS protocol version.
# ..when MariaDB is compiled with OpenSSL:
#ssl-cipher = TLSv1.2
# ..when MariaDB is compiled with YaSSL (default in Debian):
#ssl = on

# * InnoDB

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
